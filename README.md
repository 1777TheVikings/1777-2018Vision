# FRC Team 1777 Vision Code

This is team #1777 Viking's vision processing code for the 2018 Power Up game. This code is intended to be run on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 using a Logitech C920 webcam for video input; however, any
computer with a V4L2-compliant webcam should work for testing. This code uses OpenCV 3.4.0 and Python 2.7.12 (should work on any 2.7 subversion).
